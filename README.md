# SGBD_CoffeeShop
Project for SBGD/Database management systems where I implemented a database that could be used to manage orders in a generic coffee shop, people can borrow books and read them alongside ordering their favorite coffee, within a limited library.

Using: 
- Oracle 11g
- PL/SQL alongside SQL
- SQL developer
